Latching Power Switch

Design a circuit that uses a single button to turn an LED on and off using a toggle using Arduino.

Arduino UNO
• Push Button
• LED
• 220Ω Resistor
• 10kΩ (Pull-down) Resistor
• Connecting wires + Breadboard
Project idea: The first push turns the lion on, and the second push turns it off.
I learned how to make a power switch that turns on and off automatically, and I learned the concept of toggle.

Digital and analog
The idea is:
Design a circuit containing:
• Analog sensor (LDR)
• Digital sensor (Push Button)
• LED, and read their values using Arduino to control the

Arduino UNO
• LDR (Photoresistor)
• Push Button
• LED
• 10kΩ x2 resistor
• 220Ω resistor
• Breadboard
I learned the difference between a digital sensor and a digital sensor. Analog
I used a serial monitor.

Overall positives of the two projects:
Developed programming thinking. We used toggle logic and conditional readings.
Working with sensors. We differentiated between analog and digital sensors.
Circuit skills. We designed complete circuits using Breadboard and Arduino.
Interaction. We understood how to seamlessly connect circuits and programming.
Safe simulation. We used Tinkercad to test everything without real components.
